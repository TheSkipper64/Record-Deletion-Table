Dynamics 365 CE - Record Deletion Solution

This repository contains a Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (CE) solution package that includes a custom table named "Record Deletion".

Features:
The Record Deletion table is designed to log selected field values of a record prior to deletion, providing future reference for use in processes such as Power Automate flows.

Objects:
The package includes:
- Table Columns
- Table Forms
- Table Views
- Sample Workflows (2)
Several sample workflows for Accounts and Contacts demonstrate how to use the Record Deletion table to trigger Power Automate flows on delete events.
These workflows are disabled by default and can be enabled as needed.

Prerequisites:
To ensure proper execution of the solution, you must install the Dynamics 365 Workflow Tools in your environment. This solution leverages the "Get Record ID" functionality from the Workflow Tools.

Usage:
Import the solution package into your Dynamics 365 CE environment.
Enable the sample workflows if required.
Modify the existing workflows or create new ones.
Design Power Automate flows to utilize the Record Deletion table by triggering on the creation of a Record Deletion and filtering based on the Table Name/ID and Field Name/Value.
Note: The record Name/Id can also be used for filtering but is more so for quick reference.
This solution provides a foundation for tracking deleted records and extending functionality within your Dynamics 365 CE environment.
